# galadh key-value storage

`galadh` (sindar for tree) is a key-value storage inspired by `etcd`.

It was initially supposed to operate like single-instance `etcd` and be fully compatible with `etcdctl` utility.

It's based on simplified etcd's grpc-protobuffs (further rework needed).
Project goal is educational.

### TODO coming soon
